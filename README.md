# Classifying Penguins with Machine Learning

In this project, you will classify penguins species and practice classification algorithms you saw during the course.

The data that you will be use is a penguins dataset which contains information about penguins from 3 different species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Penguin Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/).
